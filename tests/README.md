# Tests & Simulations

In this folder there are the files needed to run the tutorials/examples. Currently, there are two cases that can be run (see wiki page for further details on how to run the models).

## Pre-processing
The example given here starts from a water discharge time series recorded at the Alpine rhine river in Switzerland.

## BASEveg simulation
Here a complete BASEveg simulation is given (already run), with all the input files needed to re-run the simulation. The river topography is based on the morphology of the Alpine Rhine river, Switzerland, which is characterized by alternate gravel bars. The simulation was run with 5 cycles, which can be reproduce re-running the pre-processing step.
